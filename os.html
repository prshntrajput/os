    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-part dashboard. The left/top section contains a master frequency chart and company filters. The right/main section displays topic cards. Clicking a card reveals its detailed content in a dedicated view below the cards. This structure separates high-level data exploration (the chart) from detailed study (the content), allowing users to quickly identify important topics and then dive deep. The flow is: see overview -> filter (optional) -> select topic -> read details. This is more usable than a simple list as it guides the user from general to specific information. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Topic frequency by company. Goal: Compare topic importance. Viz: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js). Interaction: Chart updates on filter selection. Justification: Bar charts are excellent for comparing ranked data. Library: Chart.js on Canvas.
        - Report Info: Full topic text. Goal: Inform/Educate. Presentation: Dynamically updated HTML text block. Interaction: Content appears when a topic card is clicked. Justification: Hides complexity, showing only what the user has selected, improving focus. Method: JS updating innerHTML.
        - Report Info: List of all topics. Goal: Organize/Navigate. Presentation: Grid of clickable cards. Interaction: Filters highlight relevant cards; clicking loads content. Justification: A visually appealing and intuitive navigation method. Method: HTML/Tailwind + JS.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                concept: `Imagine you're cooking a big meal. The entire recipe you're following is the **Program**. When you start cooking, the act of preparing that meal is a **Process**. It has its own kitchen space, ingredients (memory), and utensils (resources).<br><br>Now, what if you need to chop vegetables and stir a sauce at the same time to be efficient? These individual tasks within your cooking process are like **Threads**. They are smaller units of execution that share the same kitchen space and ingredients (the process's memory and resources) but work on different tasks concurrently.`,
                table: [
                    { feature: 'Weight', process: 'Heavyweight', thread: 'Lightweight' },
                    { feature: 'Memory', process: 'Isolated memory space', thread: 'Shared memory space' },

                ],
                example: `**Process**: Opening Google Chrome. The browser itself is a process. If you open a text editor like VS Code, that's a separate process. They don't share memory.<br><br>**Threads**: Inside your Chrome browser (process), each tab you open can be a separate thread. One thread renders the webpage, another plays a video, and a third runs a JavaScript animation. They all share the browser's core resources.`,
                interview: [
                    { q: 'What is the main difference between a process and a thread?', a: 'The key difference is their memory space. Processes have separate, isolated memory, while threads within the same process share memory. This makes threads faster for communication but less safe.' },
                    { q: 'Why would you use threads instead of multiple processes?', a: 'For tasks that need to share a lot of data or state. It\'s much more efficient (faster creation, less resource overhead) to use threads. For example, a word processor might use one thread for typing (UI) and another for spell-checking in the background.' },

                title: 'Process Scheduling Algorithms',
                concept: `Imagine a doctor's clinic with many patients waiting. The receptionist (the **Scheduler**) has to decide which patient the doctor (the **CPU**) sees next. The method the receptionist uses to pick the next patient is the **Scheduling Algorithm**. The goal is to be fair, see everyone in a reasonable time, and maybe prioritize urgent cases.`,
                example: `**First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: Like a queue at a ticket counter. The first person to arrive gets served first.<br><br>**Shortest Job First (SJF)**: The receptionist estimates who will take the least time and sends them in first to clear the waiting room quickly.<br><br>**Round Robin (RR)**: The doctor spends exactly 5 minutes with each patient. If the issue isn't resolved, the patient goes back to the end of the line.`,
                interview: [
                    { q: 'Explain the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.', a: 'It\'s a preemptive algorithm where each process is given a small, fixed unit of CPU time called a "time quantum". If the process finishes, it exits. If not, it\'s moved to the back of the ready queue, and the CPU is given to the next process. This ensures no process waits indefinitely.' },
                    { q: 'What is the "convoy effect" and where does it occur?', a: 'The convoy effect happens in FCFS scheduling. If a very long process arrives before several short processes, the short processes have to wait a long time for the long one to finish. It\'s like being stuck in a single-lane road behind a very slow truck.' },

                title: 'Thread Synchronization',
                concept: `Let's go back to the kitchen. Two chefs (threads) are working on the same recipe (process) and need to use a single, special jar of spice (a shared resource). If both try to grab the jar at the same time, they might spill it or mess up the recipe. **Thread Synchronization** is a set of techniques to ensure that when multiple threads access a shared resource, they do so in a controlled and predictable way, avoiding chaos.`,
                example: `**Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**: Think of a key to a private room. Only one chef can have the key at a time. To use the spice jar, a chef must first acquire the key (lock the mutex). After they are done, they put the key back (unlock the mutex).<br><br>**Semaphore**: Think of a bike rental station with a limited number of bikes. The semaphore is the counter at the entrance that shows how many bikes are available.`,
                interview: [
                    { q: 'What\'s the difference between a binary semaphore and a mutex?', a: 'While a binary semaphore (count of 1) can function like a mutex, the key difference is ownership. A mutex must be unlocked by the same thread that locked it. A semaphore\'s signal operation can be done by any thread.' },
                    { q: 'When would you use a semaphore over a mutex?', a: 'When you need to control access to a pool of multiple resources (e.g., database connections) or for complex signaling scenarios like the Producer-Consumer problem.' },

            },
            4: {
                title: 'Deadlocks',
                concept: `Imagine two people walking towards each other in a narrow hallway. To be polite, both step to their right. Now they are blocking each other again. Neither can move forward. This is a **deadlock**. In computing, a deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are blocked forever, each waiting for a resource that is held by another process in the group.`,
                example: `Process A locks Resource 1. Process B locks Resource 2. Now, Process A tries to lock Resource 2 but must wait for B. Simultaneously, Process B tries to lock Resource 1 but must wait for A. Neither can proceed.`,
                interview: [
                    { q: 'What are the four conditions for deadlock?', a: '1. Mutual Exclusion, 2. Hold and Wait, 3. No Preemption, 4. Circular Wait.'},
                    { q: 'How can you prevent deadlocks?', a: 'By ensuring at least one of the four conditions is never met. For example, break circular wait by enforcing a strict resource ordering.' },
                    { q: 'What is the difference between deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance?', a: '**Prevention** involves designing a system where deadlocks are structurally impossible. **Avoidance** is more dynamic, using algorithms like Banker\'s to ensure the system never enters an unsafe state.' },
